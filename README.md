# Hiya! 👋

My name is Dejun and I am a software engineer who genuinely enjoys the creativity and challenges of developing software! I love learning new languages and frameworks, and applying what I've learned in my free time (and at my job). Fullstack Applications, chat room apps, web-based games, Twitter bots, APIs, or just a simple landing page, you will probably find them all here! One of my 2023 goals is to network with other developers so let's connect or feel free to fork a project I am working on and/or submit a pull request or two! Thanks for reading!
