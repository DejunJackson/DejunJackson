# Hiya! 👋

I'm Dejun and I am a self-taught programmer who loves to build things! Fullstack Applications, Web Games, or just a simple landing page, you will probably find them all here! One of my 2021 goals is to network with other developers so let's connect!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Card library using a Hearthstone Api
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Reactjs
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Reactjs or Python
- 💬 Ask me about anything!
